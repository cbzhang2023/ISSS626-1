This shows that their referencing system and coordinate values are referred to similar spatial context. This is very important in any geospatial analysis.\nAlternatively, we can also prepare a pin map by using the code chunk below.\n\n\nCode\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(childcare_sf)+\n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\nNotice that at the interactive mode, tmap is using leaflet for R API. The advantage of this interactive pin map is it allows us to navigate and zoom around the map freely. We can also query the information of each simple feature (i.e. the point) by clicking of them. Last but not least, you can also change the background of the internet map layer. Currently, three internet map layers are provided. They are: ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas, OpenStreetMap, and ESRI.WorldTopoMap. The default is ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas.\n\nReminder: Always remember to switch back to plot mode after the interactive map. This is because, each interactive mode will consume a connection. You should also avoid displaying ecessive numbers of interactive maps (i.e. not more than 10) in one RMarkdown document when publish on Netlify."

The easiest way is to delete the duplicates. But, that will also mean that some useful point events will be lost.\nThe second solution is use jittering, which will add a small perturbation to the duplicate points so that they do not occupy the exact same space.\nThe third solution is to make each point “unique” and then attach the duplicates of the points to the patterns as marks, as attributes of the points. Then you would need analytical techniques that take into account these marks.\nThe code chunk below implements the jittering approach.\n\n\nCode\nchildcare_ppp_jit &lt;- rjitter(childcare_ppp, \n                             retry=TRUE, \n                             nsim=1, \n                             drop=TRUE)\n\n\n\nDIY: Using the method you learned in previous section, check if any dusplicated point in this geospatial data.\n\n\n\nCode\nany(duplicated(childcare_ppp_jit))\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Creating owin object\nWhen analysing spatial point patterns, it is a good practice to confine the analysis with a geographical area like Singapore boundary.

This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\n\nCode\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata2020 %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ), \n          .funs = list(toupper)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` &gt; 0)\n\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\n\nCode\nmpsz_pop2020 &lt;- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.\n\n\n\nCode\nwrite_rds(mpsz_pop2020, \"data/mpszpop2020.rds\")"

    "section": "2.4 Choropleth Mapping Geospatial Data Using tmap",
    "text": "2.4 Choropleth Mapping Geospatial Data Using tmap\nChoropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n2.4.1 Plotting a choropleth map quickly by using qtm()\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below.\n\n\nCode\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020, \n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Creating a choropleth map by using tmap’s elements\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, we will share with you tmap functions that used to plot these elements.\n\n2.4.2.1 Drawing a base map\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.2 Drawing a choropleth map using tm_polygons()\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n2.4.2.3 Drawing a choropleth map using tm_fill() and *tm_border()**\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Data classification methods of tmap\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n2.4.3.1 Plotting choropleth maps with built-in classification methods\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\n\n\n\n2.4.3.2 Plotting choropleth map with custome break\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\n\nCode\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1111  0.7147  0.7866  0.8585  0.8763 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Colour Scheme\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n2.4.4.1 Using ColourBrewer palette\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map is shaded in green.\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\n2.4.5 Map Layouts\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\n2.4.5.1 Map Legend\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"jenks\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5.2 Map style\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed.

    "text": "1.7 Working with Projection\nMap projection is an important property of a geospatial data. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, we need to ensure that both geospatial data are projected using similar coordinate system.\nIn this section, you will learn how to project a simple feature data frame from one coordinate system to another coordinate system. The technical term of this process is called projection transformation.\n\n1.7.1 Assigning EPSG code to a simple feature data frame\nOne of the common issue that can happen during importing geospatial data into R is that the coordinate system of the source data was either missing (such as due to missing .proj for ESRI shapefile) or wrongly assigned during the importing process.\nThis is an example the coordinate system of mpsz simple feature data frame by using st_crs() of sf package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nCode\nst_crs(mpsz)\n\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: SVY21 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21[WGS84]\",\n        DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",6326]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]],\n    CONVERSION[\"unnamed\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"(E)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]],\n        AXIS[\"(N)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]]]\n\n\nAlthough mpsz data frame is projected in svy21 but when we read until the end of the print, it indicates that the EPSG is 9001.

This is because geographic coordinate system is not appropriate if the analysis need to use distance or/and area measurements.\nLet us take preschool simple feature data frame as an example. The print below reveals that it is in wgs84 coordinate system.\nGeometry set for 2290 features  Geometry type: POINT Dimension:     XYZ Bounding box:  xmin: 103.6878 ymin: 1.247759 xmax: 103.9897 ymax: 1.462134 z_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0 Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84 First 5 geometries:\nThis is a scenario that st_set_crs() is not appropriate and st_transform() of sf package should be used. This is because we need to reproject preschool from one coordinate system to another coordinate system mathemetically.\nLet us perform the projection transformation by using the code chunk below.\n\n\nCode\npreschool3414 &lt;- st_transform(preschool, \n                              crs = 3414)\n\n\n\nNote: In practice, we need find out the appropriate project coordinate system to use before performing the projection transformation.\n\nNext, let us display the content of preschool3414 sf data frame as shown below.\nGeometry set for 2290 features  Geometry type: POINT Dimension:     XYZ Bounding box:  xmin: 11810.03 ymin: 25596.33 xmax: 45404.24 ymax: 49300.88 z_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0 Projected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM First 5 geometries:\nNotice that it is in svy21 projected coordinate system now. Furthermore, if you refer to Bounding box:, the values are greater than 0-360 range of decimal degree commonly used by most of the geographic coordinate systems."

This is because it is not a geospatial data but among the data fields, there are two fields that capture the x- and y-coordinates of the data points.\nIn this section, you will learn how to import an aspatial data into R environment and save it as a tibble data frame. Next, you will convert it into a simple feature data frame.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the listings.csv data downloaded from AirBnb will be used.\n\n1.8.1 Importing the aspatial data\nSince listings data set is in csv file format, we will use read_csv() of readr package to import listing.csv as shown the code chunk below. The output R object is called listings and it is a tibble data frame.\n\n\nCode\nlistings &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/listings.csv\")\n\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe code chunk below shows list() of Base R instead of glimpse() is used to do the job.\n\n\nCode\nlist(listings) \n\n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 3,540 × 18\n       id name      host_id host_name neighbourhood_group neighbourhood latitude\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  71609 Ensuite …  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n 2  71896 B&B  Roo…  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n 3  71903 Room 2-n…  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n 4 275343 10min wa… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n 5 275344 15 mins … 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n 6 289234 Booking …  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.34\n 7 294281 5 mins w… 1521514 Elizabeth Central Region      Newton            1.31\n 8 324945 Comforta… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n 9 330095 Relaxing… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n10 344803 Budget s…  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n# ℹ 3,530 more rows\n# ℹ 11 more variables: longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, room_type &lt;chr&gt;, price &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   minimum_nights &lt;dbl&gt;, number_of_reviews &lt;dbl&gt;, last_review &lt;date&gt;,\n#   reviews_per_month &lt;dbl&gt;, calculated_host_listings_count &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   availability_365 &lt;dbl&gt;, number_of_reviews_ltm &lt;dbl&gt;, license &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nThe output reveals that listing tibble data frame consists of 4252 rows and 16 columns.

    "text": "7.6 Network KDE (NKDE) Analysis\nIn this section, we will perform NKDE analysis by using appropriate functions provided in spNetwork package.\n\n7.6.1 Preparing the lixels objects\nBefore computing NKDE, the SpatialLines object need to be cut into lixels with a specified minimal distance. This task can be performed by using with lixelize_lines() of spNetwork as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nlixels &lt;- lixelize_lines(network, \n                         700, \n                         mindist = 375)\n\nWhat can we learned from the code chunk above:\n\nThe length of a lixel, lx_length is set to 700m, and\nThe minimum length of a lixel, mindist is set to 350m.\n\nAfter cut, if the length of the final lixel is shorter than the minimum distance, then it is added to the previous lixel. If NULL, then mindist = maxdist/10. Also note that the segments that are already shorter than the minimum distance are not modified\nNote: There is another function called lixelize_lines.mc() which provide multicore support.\n\n\n7.6.2 Generating line centre points\nNext, lines_center() of spNetwork will be used to generate a SpatialPointsDataFrame (i.e. samples) with line centre points as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nsamples &lt;- lines_center(lixels) \n\nThe points are located at center of the line based on the length of the line.\n\n\n7.6.3 Performing NKDE\nWe are ready to computer the NKDE by using the code chunk below.\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network, \n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300, \n                  div= \"bw\", \n                  method = \"simple\", \n                  digits = 1, \n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1), \n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5, \n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\nkernel_name argument indicates that quartic kernel is used. Are possible kernel methods supported by spNetwork are: triangle, gaussian, scaled gaussian, tricube, cosine ,triweight, epanechnikov or uniform.\nmethod argument indicates that simple method is used to calculate the NKDE. Currently, spNetwork support three popular methods, they are:\n\nmethod=“simple”. This first method was presented by Xie et al. (2008) and proposes an intuitive solution. The distances between events and sampling points are replaced by network distances, and the formula of the kernel is adapted to calculate the density over a linear unit instead of an areal unit.\nmethod=“discontinuous”. The method is proposed by Okabe et al (2008), which equally “divides” the mass density of an event at intersections of lixels.\nmethod=“continuous”. If the discontinuous method is unbiased, it leads to a discontinuous kernel function which is a bit counter-intuitive. Okabe et al (2008) proposed another version of the kernel, that divide the mass of the density at intersection but adjusts the density before the intersection to make the function continuous.\n\n\nThe user guide of spNetwork package provide a comprehensive discussion of nkde(). You should read them at least once to have a basic understanding of the various parameters that can be used to calibrate the NKDE model.\n\n7.6.3.1 Visualising NKDE\nBefore we can visualise the NKDE values, code chunk below will be used to insert the computed density values (i.e. densities) into samples and lixels objects as density field.\n\nsamples$density &lt;- densities\nlixels$density &lt;- densities\n\nSince svy21 projection system is in meter, the computed density values are very small i.e. 0.0000005. The code chunk below is used to resale the density values from number of events per meter to number of events per kilometer.\n\n# rescaling to help the mapping\nsamples$density &lt;- samples$density*1000\nlixels$density &lt;- lixels$density*1000\n\nThe code below uses appropriate functions of tmap package to prepare interactive and high cartographic quality map visualisation.\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(lixels)+\n  tm_lines(col=\"density\")+\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots()\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\nThe interactive map above effectively reveals road segments (darker color) with relatively higher density of childcare centres than road segments with relatively lower density of childcare centres (lighter color)"

The null hypothesis is defined as:\nHo: The observed spatial point events (i.e distribution of childcare centres) are uniformly distributed over a street network in Punggol Planning Area.\nThe CSR test is based on the assumption of the binomial point process which implies the hypothesis that the childcare centres are randomly and independently distributed over the street network.\nIf this hypothesis is rejected, we may infer that the distribution of childcare centres are spatially interacting and dependent on each other; as a result, they may form nonrandom patterns.\n\nkfun_childcare &lt;- kfunctions(network, \n                             childcare,\n                             start = 0, \n                             end = 1000, \n                             step = 50, \n                             width = 50, \n                             nsim = 50, \n                             resolution = 50,\n                             verbose = FALSE, \n                             conf_int = 0.05)\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\nThere are ten arguments used in the code chunk above they are:\n\nlines: A SpatialLinesDataFrame with the sampling points.

In the above example, 50 simulation was performed. Note: most of the time, more simulations are required for inference\nresolution: When simulating random points on the network, selecting a resolution will reduce greatly the calculation time. When resolution is null the random points can occur everywhere on the graph. If a value is specified, the edges are split according to this value and the random points are selected vertices on the new network.\nconf_int: A double indicating the width confidence interval (default = 0.05).\n\nFor the usage of other arguments, you should refer to the user guide of spNetwork package.\nThe output of kfunctions() is a list with the following values:\n\nplotkA, a ggplot2 object representing the values of the k-function\nplotgA, a ggplot2 object representing the values of the g-function\nvaluesA, a DataFrame with the values used to build the plots\n\nFor example, we can visualise the ggplot2 object of k-function by using the code chunk below.\n\nkfun_childcare$plotk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue line is the empirical network K-function of the childcare centres in Punggol planning area. The gray envelop represents the results of the 50 simulations in the interval 2.5% - 97.5%. Because the blue line between the distance of 250m-400m are below the gray area, we can infer that the childcare centres in Punggol planning area resemble regular pattern at the distance of 250m-400m."
